# Data for LeDataSciFi

## Info for students

- If you have any questions, send it to me via the [`Issues` tab](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/data/issues/new/choose)
- Firm year datasets contain firm-year info (e.g. total assets for Tesla in 2018). Most of the variables are from [Compustat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compustat), but some are from other sources.
- You can find documentation on CRSP and Compustat from around the web if what is here doesn't suffice. (I haven't made large investments in this repo.)

## Info for me

This is a place we store data used across many years of class. This means I don't need to constantly update URLs in code. 

To ensure links to these files continue to work, do not rename folders or files once placed here.
